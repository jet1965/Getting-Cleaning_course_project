# Getting-Cleaning_course_project
An R script for downloading, collating, and tidying a specific data set of sensor readings.

To produce a text file containing a tidy data set of the mean values of the mean 
and standard deviation readings of each observation by activity and subject, simply 
clone this repo, cd into the main directory, and type the following commands:

source run_analysis.R

run_analysis()

The data is already in place and unzipped, within the directory structure. If you 
wish, you can download it fresh by simply uncommenting the first two lines of code 
in the run_analysis.R file, resourcing it and rerunning it. This will make the 
script download the zip file and unzip it, overwriting the existing data.
